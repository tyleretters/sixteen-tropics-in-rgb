# sixteen-tropics-in-rgb

```
Sixteen tropics in RGB,
Encircle my dead weight.

I watched the hole in the ozone layer,
Dilate.

I saw second impact,
With seminal eyes.

When the reefs ossified,
I couldn't sea, because

The San Andreas Pyrocumulus Palouse,
Was burning again.

One day,
They'll notice eclipses again.
